# LED Game

A game on an Arduino robot where you try to press buttons before time runs out!

## Setup

You will need: an Arduino robot, 3 LEDs, 3 buttons, a resistor, and some wires.

Connect one end of each button to pins 2, 3, and 4, and the other end to ground.

Connect one end of each LED to pins 5, 6, and 7, and the other end to a resistor connected to ground.
(Make sure the LEDs are facing the right way or they won't light up.)

Place the button on pin 2 near the LED on pin 5,
the button on pin 3 near the LED on pin 6,
and the button on pin 4 near the LED on pin 7.

Upload the sketch to the Arduino.

## How to Play

Turn on the Arduino. One LED should light up.

When an LED lights up, press the corresponding button as fast as possible.

Try to go as long as you can before you press the wrong button or take too long.

When the game ends, push the reset button on the Arduino to play again.

Have fun!
